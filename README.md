As an outdoor enthusiast, I love exploring all of the national parks across the US!
This Power BI dashboard analyzes just how busy the parks get on an annual basis. 

1. I took a raw data set of NPS data from 2000-2016, reviewed and cleaned the contents of the data.
2. Uploaded the clean data into Powerbi to create a data visualization.
3. Created a data visualization summary tab that explored annual visitor data, and the most visited national parks.
    Data elements included: line chart, stacked bar chart, filter by top n, KPI scorecards, aggreagting data
